# CITZ-IMB-Capstone2020

CITZ-IMB Modern Application Playbook Progressive Web Application Exemplar/Starter-kit

## Introduction

OCIO-ES-IMB is the Ministry of Citizen’s Services Information Management Branch. The IMBs mandate includes:

- Engaging with Ministry Business Units to support their IM/IT project initiatives
- Providing IM/IT Application Management Services including support and operational maintenance for over 80 applications on behalf of CITZ Ministry Business Units 
- Providing STRA and PIA services for the Ministry
- Providing Infrastructure Management Services for Ministry clients
- Operating the IMB Support Desk
- Reporting to the Ministry CIO (MCIO)

To support IMBs overall strategic IM/IT initiatives,a Modern Application Playbook is required that will aid Ministry Business Units in their new application development journeys. To support the playbook a 12-Factor compliant Capstone2020 Progressive Web Application is being developed to demonstrate the Modern Application Playbook.

## Problem Statement

The OCIO-ES-IMB does not have a consistent playbook to aid in the development of Modern Applications by Ministry business units.

## Hypothesis

If we have a modern application playbook our stakeholders, partners and vendors will have a set of tested, repeatable patterns that will guide their journeys in the development of modern applications from product ideation through to the sustainment lifecycle to aid in consistent and efficient use of limited resourcses that make use of current best practices.

## Goal

The Goal of the Capstone2020 project team is to create an installable progressive Web App as a solution 'exemplar/starter-it'

Objectives include:

- Apply modern application development methodology based on AGILE principles
- Demonstrate creation of a system that supports the BC Governments Digital Framework.
- Create a Progressive Web Application that project teams can fork and use as a starter-kit
- Demonstrate the usage of an Application Programming Interface  from the BC Data API Catalogue
- Host the solution in the BC Dev Exchanges’ container environment
